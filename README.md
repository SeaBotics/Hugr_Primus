# Hugr_Primus – SeaBotics' First Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV)

**Hugr_Primus** is the first development project in SeaBotics' Hugr series — an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) platform designed and built by students. The objective is to develop a fully autonomous vessel capable of navigating a predefined route, avoiding obstacles, and performing automatic docking.

## Technology Stack

Development is primarily done in **Python** and **C++**, using a **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** framework running on **Ubuntu (Linux)**.

## Core Objectives

- Autonomous route following  
- Obstacle detection and avoidance  
- Automatic docking  
- Integration of autopilot  
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) exploration

## Onboard Hardware

- **GNSS with RTK support** (Global Navigation Satellite System with Real-Time Kinematic)
- **IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- **LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging)
- **Depth camera**
- **5G modem with antenna**
- **Thrusters**
- **LiFePO4 batteries** (Lithium Iron Phosphate)

## Project Status

This repository serves as the central codebase for all Hugr_Primus development.
